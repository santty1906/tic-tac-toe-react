## ðŸ§  How It Works

- The board is a 3x3 grid of buttons (`<Square />`) rendered by the `<Board />` component.
- Player X starts first.
- After each click, the board updates and checks for a winner using the `calculateWinner()` function.
- If a player wins, the game displays the winner.
- If all squares are filled with no winner, the game ends in a draw.
